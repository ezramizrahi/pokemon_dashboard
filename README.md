## About

A Pokémon dashboard that displays information such as:
* Pokémon that you've recently caught
* Current location and Pokémon in the area
* Stats on badges earned
* Stats on the Pokémon you're carrying

It uses `async await` patterns and React Hooks to consume and display data from [PokéApi - The RESTful Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/).
